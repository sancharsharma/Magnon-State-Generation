These are the codes for the paper ... If (1) the code is confusing or buggy; (2) you would like to collaborate; (3) you would like to develop the code further; (4) you want to tell me something interesting, feel free to contact me at sanchar.sharma@mpl.mpg.de or sancharsharma@gmail.com.

The plots in the paper are generated by Wigner_Plots.py and Fidelity_Plots.py. 

Wigner_Plots.py:
  For a given set of states, run the protocol to find the states achieved along with the fidelity of generation and plot the Wigner function of target and achieved states side by side. 
  
Fidelity_Plots.py:
  For a given class of states, plot the fidelity as a function of some continuous or discrete parameter.

One should be able to run these files by downloading all the files and keeping them in one folder. For reference, the fidelity data is already stored in DataStateGeneration.hdf5.
